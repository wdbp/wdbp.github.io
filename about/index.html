    <p>Hi, I'm <a href="http://dereknutile.com/" target="_blank">Derek Nutile</a>.</p>
    <p>I've been around information systems since the early 1990's and consider myself a pretty well rounded technologist with a strength for efficiency and automation and a passion for making web applications.</p>

    <p>This site illustrates what I consider to be a generic way to operate under perfect conditions.  But a lot of what I purport to be best practices are hard or impossible to attain in every environment.  The exercise here is simple: document what works, change it when it doesn't, and try to apply it where you can.</p>
