    <p>Standardize the process and simplify the workflow to consistently deliver a solid, secure product that we can be proud of.</p>
    <h2 id="purpose" class="anchor">Purpose</h2>
    <p>In order to improve efficiency, we need to standardize our processes, the tools we use, and how we use them in an interactive team-focused way.  Standardizing our tools, frameworks, libraries, coding style, and version control will allow us to share our vocabulary and understand better the inner workings of each individual developers work which will result in providing a consistently better experience for the customer.
    <p>These best practices are not meant to be restrictive or comprehensive, but rather, a dynamic and agile guideline.  The aim is for this document to provide firm guidance but not be an authoritative dictum.</p>
    <p>This document can, and should be updated to reflect changes to the current development ecosystem.  Any modifications to this guide should be as generic as possible by default, and only specific when required.  For example, making generic points about PHP and specific points about PHP7 only feature has the effect of keeping the guideline "future-proof."</p>
